Objective:-
To create a real-time digital clock web application that displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds using JavaScript.

Technologies Used:-
- HTML5 – For structuring the clock display
- CSS3 – For styling and responsiveness
- JavaScript – For dynamically updating the time every second

 Features:-
- Displays real-time system time (hours, minutes, seconds)
- Automatically updates every second
- Responsive design that works across desktop and mobile devices
- Styled interface with modern layout and clean typography

Implementation Steps:-
1. Structured the clock UI using semantic HTML.
2. Styled the layout with CSS for center alignment, fonts, and background.
3. Used setInterval() in JavaScript to update the time every second.
4. Extracted the current time using the Date object.
5. Displayed time in HH:MM:SS format with leading zeros where needed.

Outcome:-
A simple, lightweight digital clock that updates in real time and demonstrates JavaScript DOM manipulation and time-based functions. This project is a great example of using core front-end web technologies to create interactive UI elements.
